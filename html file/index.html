        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

        <p>Doraemon, the iconic blue robot cat from the future,
            is always ready to help his best friend Nobita with
            his quirky gadgets, despite the many mishaps that
            often arise. With his round face, small bell on his collar,
            and a seemingly endless pocket of futuristic tools, Doraemon
            tries his best to guide Nobita through life’s challenges.
            Whether it's fixing a problem at school or helping Nobita
            with his latest scheme, Doraemon’s constant optimism and
            loyalty make him the perfect companion. However, it’s not
            just his gadgets that make him special—Doraemon’s caring nature and knack for turning even the most chaotic
            situations into learning experiences show that, sometimes, the best way to solve a problem is with heart.
